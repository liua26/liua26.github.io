            <p>Hey! Welcome to my quirky end of the internet. <br>
              Let me introduce myself a little bit.<br>
              My name is Annie Liu, I am going into my first year of <br>
              post secondary at Carleton University here in Ottawa. <br>
              I'm studying computer science with a specialization in <br>
              machine learning and artificial intelligence!</p>

            <p>I am a very people oriented person and I feel like <br>
              this is heavily reflected in my previous jobs as a lifeguard,<br>
              coach and sales representative! </p>
            <p>I love listening to music, in my off time you can almost <br>
              always see me with headphones in and jamming out to some tunes :)</p>
            <p>I am very interested in anything and everything about media and music, <br>
            in high school my course load was very media production related and I really <br>
            wanted to study media production in university.</p>
